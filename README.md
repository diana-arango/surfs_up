## Oahu urfs_up Analysis 

### Overview:
The purpose of this analysis is to assist W. Avy in analysing the temperature trends for the months of June and December in Oahu before opening a surf shop in the island. By comparing some statistical information will help W. Avy to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

### Results
Summary statistics for June
https://github.com/diana-arango/surfs_up/blob/main/June_results.jpg

According to the observations run during June:
1.	75% of the month period has a temperature between 75 to 77 F with a variation of 2 to 3 points only. The other 25% is also between 70 F. 
2.	The lowest temperature is 64 F
3.	The observations run, demonstrate that the month of June has a consistent nice weather temperature

According to the observations run during December:
https://github.com/diana-arango/surfs_up/blob/main/December_results.jpg

1.	Similar than June, 75% of the month period has a temperature of 74F. Nevertheless, its temperature varies 4 points which makes the month a little bit cooler 
2.	25 % of the month reaches a temperature of 69F. 
3.	The lowest temperature is 56 F
4.	The observations run, demonstrate that there is a 50% change that the temperature during the month of December don’t get above 70 F which might affect the surf shop performance 

### Summary

To Conclude: June’s temperature will favor Avy’s shop performance due to its consistency and small variation. On the other hand, December could not offer the same results as its temperature varies from 71 F to 69F during 25% of the month period. Perhaps, considering running the shop for just the 75 % of the month might allow Avy to obtain his expected return.
A query that can solve this problem, could be, determining daily temperatures during the month of December; then Avy can have an idea of when to keep the shop close.
